  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page Discademia marketing site with header, hero, tutoring, faculty, notes, live sessions, and footer plus a blue/white theme. However, some acceptance criteria/constraints are not evidenced (notably generated image assets placement and non-fictional faculty copy), and several unrequested features are introduced (Internet Identity/react-query scaffolding, external attribution link, and backend canister stub).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Faculty profiles must be professional and non-fictional; if placeholders are used they must be clearly indicated as sample profiles and avoid unverifiable claims.",
      "reason": "Faculty cards include specific names and credentials/claims (e.g., PhD, Cambridge-certified, 'proven track records') without being labeled as sample placeholders, which risks violating the requirement to avoid unverifiable claims.",

      "requirement": "Add the required generated static images under frontend/public/assets/generated and render them (logo in header/footer; hero illustration in intro).",
      "reason": "Components reference the expected image paths, but the diff summary does not show the generated image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

    {
      "description": "Internet Identity + react-query provider wiring and actor hook added (authentication scaffolding) despite the request being for a static marketing site and non-goals excluding login/accounts.",
