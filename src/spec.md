# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive, single-page marketing website for Discademia (an online tutoring platform for O/A Level students) with a consistent professional blue-and-white theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page layout with a cohesive blue/white design system (typography, buttons, section styling, interactive states) and fully English, non-placeholder copy.
- Add a top navigation header with Discademia branding and anchor links to: Welcome/Intro, 1:1 Tutoring, Faculty, Notes & Mark Schemes, Live Sessions (mobile-friendly behavior included).
- Implement a Welcome/Intro hero section with headline, supporting paragraph, and a primary CTA button.
- Add content sections for: “1:1 Tutoring Classes”, “Introducing Faculty” (profile card grid), “Notes & Mark Schemes”, and “Live Sessions”, each in a scannable layout and reachable via anchors.
- Add a footer with Discademia branding, a short tutoring-appropriate tagline, and simple contact placeholders.
- Add required static generated images as frontend assets (logo in header/footer; hero illustration in intro) stored under `frontend/public/assets/generated`.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll a polished, responsive Discademia landing page, use the top navigation to jump to key service sections, see a clear intro with CTA, and view branded visuals (logo and hero illustration).
